## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- **Bonus**: See the chat interface animate on the initial load

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Netlify](https://chatapp-illustration-css.netlify.app/)

## My process
- Download the figma design to get closer look at how to plan my layout structure for completing the challenge.
- Structure the html layout with added css class names for styling and making responsive.
- Restructure the pill div linear graidient designs to better control for responsiveness.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned
CSS can get tricky when a design layout like this challenge requires there to be patterns on the page behind the content. Especially for structuring and creating css class names for the html structure to be fluid and responsive across devices.



### Continued development

I'll have to revisit some html and css fundamentals as I keep completing more challenges to get a better eye for tricky layouts that will be in other challenges like this one.


### Useful resources

- [Elb Henrys solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-louCKnbf4) - Elb Henrys solution helped me understand having the pill placements in the background by having z-index of -1 and position absolute to achieve having the layout to be easily controlled for their placements when writing the tablet and mobile device layouts. I still kept my original code while taking the position absolute solution to put into mine without needing to copy his full solution. Credit all goes to Elb Henry.
